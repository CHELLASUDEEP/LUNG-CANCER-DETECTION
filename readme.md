# LUNG CANCER DETECTION

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for the detection of lung cancer from medical images. The project uses TensorFlow and Keras to build and train Multiple models using transfer learning on a dataset of lung images categorized into 3 different types of lung cancer and normal images.

In this project, we have trained multiple models using transfer learning techniques and normal CNN models for better accuracies and understanding.

# REQUIREMENTS
1) TensorFlow
2) Keras
3) Matplotlib
4) OpenCV
5) NumPy

# ABOUT DATASET
Dataset consists of 3 directories train,test,valid. Each directory has 3 types of lung cancer images folder and 1 normal lung images folder.
